# Puppet Zivtech Apt

This module just adds the [Zivtech](https://zivtech.com) apt
repository and corresponding GPG key so that software
published to the apt repository can be installed. Generally,
this module should only be installed because it is a dependency
of another module like
[drupal-solr](https://github.com/zivtech/puppet-drupal-solr).
